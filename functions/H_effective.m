function [ H_eff ] = H_effective( X,x,varargin)
%H_EFFECTIVE computes the effective field at all grid / lattice sites 
%   The program generates an energy surface using the desired terms, and
%   then takes the derivative of this surface to compute the effective
%   field
%   inputs: X - refference lattice positions
%           x - current lattice positions
